# Project Guidelines

This repository contains files and information corresponding to project asked in the course.

## Scripts considerations for the raw data

The script uses the zip file, so it verifies that this file is on working directory. In case it isn't, the script download it from the indicated website. After that, the script unzip the file overwriting all previous and existing files. With this approach, I assure that all needed files exists in the needed directories.

The script will work with the corresponding directory structure contained in zip file.

Note: The script assumes that the zip file is not corrupted and in case needed, exists a Internet connection to download zip file.
